        My journey in the world of coding began in 2023 when I joined GIAIC to pursue my passion for technology. During my time here, I have mastered key skills such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind, laying a strong foundation for my future in web development.


Before diving into the tech world, I pursued an Advanced Diploma in Media Science at Arena Multimedia, which gave me a creative edge. I worked as a 2D Animator with Express News on a freelance basis, where I contributed to several dynamic projects. Alongside this, I honed my skills as a 3D Artist, specializing in hard surface modeling while working with various clients as a freelancer.


Now, with a solid background in both creativity and technology, I am determined to explore and excel in emerging technologies to expand my expertise and make a meaningful impact in the industry.
